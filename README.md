# ABOUT

Full stack developer and math teacher, I have many skills
important to effectively perform various tasks. Among them, the most
important and that I personally highlight, is that I learn quickly, I am curious,
versatile but not for that inconsistent. I think that something that defines me the most is
constancy in terms of problem solving.
